# WeWork-UI
This is a remake of We work's website UI where I added a few animations using js and css libraries.

*All CDNs and additional scripts are already there in the repo so it is ready to use immediately after cloning.

This website UI is not yet responsive. I have'nt added any media queries yet and still been able to achieve a considerable amount of responsivness due to bootsrap classes.

Bugs to be fixed for responsivness:-
1. Background image on small screens
2. footer section height

Will be updating this to the full version very soon. 
Planning on adding new features of login logout to this or the next project.
To get this locally on your device to work on, you can type "git clone 'HTTPS'" on your git bash to get this on your device. 
To add repository in a particular folder you can use "git clone 'HTTPS' <folder-name>" command to add it to a particular folder.
