# WeWork-UI
This is a remake of We work's website UI where I added a few animations using js and css libraries.

**All CDNs and additional scripts are already there in the repo so it is ready to use immediately after cloning.**


Will be updating this to the full version very soon. 
Planning on adding new features of login logout to this or the next project.

### To get the repo on local machine-

* To get this locally on your device to work on, you can type `git clone https://github.com/Pranav016/WeWork-UI.git` on your git bash to get this on your device. </br>

* To add repository in a particular folder you can use `git clone https://github.com/Pranav016/WeWork-UI.git 'folder-name'` command to add it to a particular folder.</br>

### Environment setup-

I would suggest VS code or Sublime text as code editors to work on this project. Both are very light weight code editors and have great extension support. Download links are given below-</br>

1. VS-code: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
Extensions recommended- </br>
* Live Server 
* Intellisense for css


2. Sublime text: https://www.sublimetext.com/
